**Project description:** The goal of the project was to compare how well areas around the bay due as it relates to the bays health. Looked at census data within 10 miles of the bay for median household income averaged over 5 years. I used the health grades given out to the 5 different regions during that same time period to compare 2010-2014 and 2015-2019

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena
The results are mostly inconclusive. This project would provide more results if I created similar maps dating back 20 or 30 years.
